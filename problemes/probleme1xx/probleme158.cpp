    // Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet, character strings of length three can be formed.
    // Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
    // When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters come lexicographically
    // after its neighbour to the left.
    // For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx'
    // there are zero characters that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
    // In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its
    // neighbour to the left.
    // 
    // We now consider strings of n â‰¤ 26 different characters from the alphabet.
    // For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly one character comes lexicographically
    // after its neighbour to the left.
    //
    // What is the maximum value of p(n)?
